{{< todo >}}tenses{{< /todo >}}I've just started writing material for this website{{< sidenote "(" ")" "" "." >}}it was [this post](/posts/2023-06-27_projects-intro), if you were curious{{< /sidenote >}}, and I noticed that for some reason I've been writing in a more formal style than usual. Then I realized that it almost sounds like something ChatGPT would write. So, I thought I would start a log of my current thoughts on ChatGPT; not a comprehensive exploration of the topic, but simply my current thoughts and how (if at all) I currently use it.

### Current Usage

{{< todo >}}Add ChatGPT stats (interactive chart shortcode??){{< /todo >}}
As of today, here's a chart of every message I've exchanged with ChatGPT ({{< todo >}}(Sidenote?) Link to a gist of the code I used or something (code snippets section??){{< /todo >}}):

As you can see, {{< todo >}}say something about data{{< /todo >}}. Up to this point, I've really only used ChatGPT as a novelty, or at most a lazier version of Google search. In this way, I'm not using it to its fullest potential, and worse, I could be falling behind. So, if ChatGPT is so game-changing, why have I not been using it?

### Reluctance, "Purity", and Technology

A large part of it is because I'm scared. Generative AI is one of the most pivotal advancements in artificial intelligence thus far, and I know that it will likely change the way we think about language, creativity, and communication itself.

However, it feels *comfortable* to pretend that it might as well not exist, to tell myself that I can function as an employee, creator, and human living in society without the aid of a word generating machine. It feels *purer* somehow to say no, to tell myself that by abstaining I'm preventing myself from developing an inevitable dependence on something to which I can export my thinking, creativity, and whatever other intellectual chores that were previously responsibilities only I could fulfill as someone with a uniquely human mind.

But, on the other hand, this reluctance to forfeit some form of "purity" is naive because we already do this every day in the form of technology. That's what it *does*: it augments our natural abilities by allowing us to take shortcuts, but in the process we lose control and agency.

If I want to learn something new today, I can head over to somewhere like YouTube or Wikipedia, and I will likely find knowledge that is useful to me in that moment. But in order to be immediately useful, it has to be surface level, pre-digested. I'm trading the time it would have taken to gather that information myself for control over the ability to make my own interpretation. The same could be said for ChatGPT, social media, and the news, but the same could also be said for books, manufactured products, or even going to a restaurant.

In short, this is just another chapter in the cycle of technological advancement:
1. Breakthrough
2. Friction
3. Irreversible change

I'm interested to see how my perceptions of this new technology change over time, and the ripples it will cause in society as a whole.
