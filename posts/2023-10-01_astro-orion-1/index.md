A month ago, in early September, I had been researching the [April 2024 total solar eclipse](https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/april-8-2024) and considering how I would photograph it in the event that I could make it into (or close to) the path of totality. In order to automate the process of pointing a camera at the sun, a tracking mount can be used to counter the rotation of the earth. This same type of mount can also be used to improve long-exposure photos of the night sky by eliminating (or at least reducing) star trailing in the images.{{< sidenote >}}Star trailing is when the stars in an image appear to streak across the sky as a result of Earth's rotation (see [the 500 rule](https://astrobackyard.com/the-500-rule/)).{{< /sidenote >}}

So, when I saw a [Star Adventurer Mini](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/star-adventurer-mini) star-tracking mount on eBay for $200, I took the plunge and bought it with the intention of using it for both of these purposes.
