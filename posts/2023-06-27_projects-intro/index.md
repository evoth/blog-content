{{< todo >}}Add links to Scratch (account?), cemetech.net (account/2048?), GitHub profile{{< /todo >}}Throughout the last decade, I've worked on a myriad of programming endeavors, whether it be Scratch projects, calculator games, or other "real" programming pursuits. In each instance, I'm motivated not just by the prospect of creating something cool or useful, but by the endless cycle of learning and problem solving which is at the heart of programming (or any problem solving process):
1. Encounter a problem which is impossible with your current knowledge or tools.
2. Break down the problem into discrete, solvable pieces.
3. Gather the necessary knowledge and resources to solve (or circumvent) each piece.
4. Adjust course to align with your now deeper and/or broader understanding.
5. Repeat.

Because of this, the result of programming is not just the production of code, but also the acquisition of knowledge and experience with problem solving patterns that may be applicable far beyond the scope of the original project.

My goal with this series is threefold. First, I wish to display my approach to problem solving, so that the reader may gain insight into how I confront and overcome challenges on the way to realizing a goal{{< sidenote "(" ")" >}}in other words, a portfolio of sorts{{< /sidenote >}}. Second, by documenting my problem solving process, I will be able to learn from my past endeavors, and perhaps you can too. Third, I think I've worked on some cool things and want to share them with the world!{{< sidenote "(" ")" >}}A secret fourth reason: I want to start writing things, and this website is a great way to do that!{{< /sidenote >}}

The [Projects and Problem Solving series](/series/projects) will discuss various [projects](/projects) that I've built over the years, with one or more posts being dedicated to each project.{{< todo >}}Navigation tips?{{< /todo >}}
