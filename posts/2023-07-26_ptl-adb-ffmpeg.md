By December 25th, 2019, I had never written a program in a "real" programming language, besides some tiny JavaScript webpages a few years prior. But, as my next project could not be done in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) or on my calculator (my previous development platforms of choice), that would need to change. At the time, I loved filming and watching time-lapses, so my idea was to create a system that automatically films daily time-lapse videos and uploads them to YouTube. Furthermore, my goal was to have the system up and running by January 1st, 2020, in less than a week.

I chose to use Python for the project, partly because of its reputation as an easy-to-learn language, and partly because I had utilized some Python scripts before, so I was confident that it could be used to accomplish what I needed. Throughout the project, I would search things like "Python if statements" After choosing which language to use, the next step was to break up the overall problem (an automatic time-lapse filming and uploading system) into manageable pieces. The first piece, and the topic of this post, was to programmatically film and render a time-lapse.
