## Education

As a junior computer science major at the University of Central Florida, I have taken 42 credits in computer science and 19 credits in mathematics with a 3.97 GPA. I have also had the opportunity to complete multiple projects, including working on an 8-person Agile team to create a [full-stack household management app](https://github.com/carlos-jmh/large-project/tree/mobile-main) using the Amazon Amplify ecosystem with React Native.

## Work Experience

Over summer 2023, I worked full-time as an intern with [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) to develop a prototype for an improved version of a legacy government algorithm for detecting satellites using optical ground-based imagery. First, I implemented the existing algorithm in Python, then modified it to include synthetic rate tracking, which produced a 7% improvement in satellite detection accuracy.

During fall of the same year, I interned remotely at MITRE to investigate the use of generative AI to accelerate the implementation of image processing algorithms from technical descriptions. I was able to augment an existing auto-prompting framework by adding both automatic self-documentation and an improved filesystem interface, which greatly improved its ability to create and iterate upon non-trivial code bases.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I love learning new things and working on personal projects. My newest hobby is astrophotography, and I recently had the opportunity to see the total solar eclipse on April 8th, 2024! In order to capture photos of it while still enjoying the moment, I built a system to automatically control my camera's shutter and settings over WiFi. Though I'm still working on polishing the tools for official release, you can see my [sequence editor software](https://github.com/evoth/sequent) and [motorized solar filter design](https://github.com/evoth/motorized-solar-filter) on my GitHub.
