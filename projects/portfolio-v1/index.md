Check back soon for more detailed insight on this project's inspiration, process, and lessons! For now, here's information from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/evoth/portfolio-site):

## Website

See it in action at https://v1.ethanvoth.com!

## Theme

For the sake of convenience, many of the standalone websites hosted under the ethanvoth.com domain use very similar theming. They support light and dark mode, and theme preference is stored in a shared cookie between all of them (for now). The website is styled using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), which is rendered (together with additional styling) from [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Todo

- Use tiles for skills chart instead of rows and columns
- Comment Bulma Sass (do this in FP too)
- Use templates or JSX instead of repetitive HTML
- Improve contrast and accessability
- Improve metadata and link previews
